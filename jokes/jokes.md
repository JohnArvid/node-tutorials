### Project: Random Joke Generator

**Description:**
Create a simple web app that fetches and displays random jokes from a joke API.

**Features:**

1. **Fetch Joke Button:**
   - Users can click a button to fetch and display a random joke.

2. **Joke Display:**
   - Show the fetched joke on the webpage.

**Technologies:**

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- **API:**
  - Use a Joke API (for example, the JokeAPI: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Making API requests using JavaScript.
- Displaying dynamic content on a webpage.
- Handling API responses.

**Bonus:**

- Add a button to fetch a joke from a specific category (e.g., programming jokes).
- Include a simple animation or transition when displaying a new joke.

This mini-project will give you a quick and focused introduction to consuming APIs in a fun and light-hearted context.


To make API calls for the "Random Joke Generator" project, you can use the fetch API in JavaScript. Here's a basic example of how to make an API call to a joke API:

`// Define the API endpoint
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/jokes/random';

// Make the API call using fetch
fetch(apiUrl)
  .then(response => {
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch joke');
    }
    // Parse the JSON response
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the data
    console.log(data);
    // Display the joke on the webpage or in the console
    const joke = data.joke;
    console.log(joke);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error('Error fetching joke:', error);
  });
`
In this code:

Replace 'https://api.example.com/jokes/random' with the actual URL of the joke API you want to use.
The fetch function sends a GET request to the specified URL.
We chain .then to handle the response asynchronously. Inside the first .then, we check if the response is successful (status code 200) using the ok property of the response object.
If the response is successful, we parse the JSON data using the json method, and then handle the data in the second .then.
Inside the second .then, you can access the joke data (or any other data returned by the API) and do whatever you want with it, such as displaying it on a webpage or logging it to the console.
If there's an error during the API call, the .catch block will handle it and log an error message to the console.
You can place this code inside your project's JavaScript file or script tag to fetch random jokes from the API and display them to the user.
